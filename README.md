# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 


## About Page Overview

The about page featurs a basic navbar with working link to other pages on the site. Below the navbar is a jumbotron displaying for my future developer profile along with an image that is also made to be responsive for different devices.  Below the image caption, a "Learn More" button directs the user to the Contact page of the site for now, but may be used to link a different site in the future. The table below can be used to display list of relevant info that is separated into categories. The jumbotron footer is used to display official name/saying/logo. 

## Portfolio Page Overview

The Portfolio page features the website navbar, a jumbotron displaying the page overview, a row divided into three colums to designate categories within the portfolio. Since I only have one homework published on Github so far, a card containing a link to that site (opening in new tab) was added and the other two categories are empty for now.  As the portfolio grows, the categories will be changed from "past, present, future" to some other set of distinctions. The table below the portfolio works mimics the layout of the About page while helping to push the footer jumbotron dowm to eliminate bottom margin.

## Contact Page Overview

The Contact page featurs the site navbar, a current professional profile image with contact info below. Additionally, a LinkedIn profile page was added to the website footer of this page that will take the user to my LinkedIn page.
